# ZXEightyZON â€“ Coming Soon ðŸŽ¶

**ZXEightyZON** is a new sound interface for the ZX81, built around the **YM2149F** sound chip. Designed as a timing-accurate, minimalist alternative to the AY-ZONIC-Core, this board offers clean integration with existing ZON-X81 demos and playback routines, while introducing flexible channel mixing options for stereo output.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Sound Chip**: YM2149F (AY-3-8912 compatible, timing-accurate)
- **Address Decoding**: Simple A4 decoding, mirroring ZON-X81 behavior
- **A4 Jumper**: Optional jumper to connect A4 to ZX81 bus for **ZONX compatibility**
- **Stereo Output Configuration**:
  - Channel A: Always routed to **Left**
  - Mixed Channel: Selectable via jumperâ€”either **Channel B** or **Channel C**
  - Right Channel: Automatically assigned to the **non-mixed** channel
    - If **B is mixed**, then **C is Right**
    - If **C is mixed**, then **B is Right**
- **Noise Channel Nomination**:
  - Jumper-based selection of B or C as the mixed/noise channel
  - Supports regional playback preferences:
    - Western demos typically mix **Channel B**
    - Eastern demos often mix **Channel C**
- **Compatibility**:
  - Fully compatible with ZON-X81 demos and playback logic
  - Designed for real hardware playback and experimentation

## ðŸ§ª Development Status

This project is currently in development. Stay tuned for schematics, build logs, and demo recordings. ZXEightyZON is designed to be simple, flexible, and funâ€”perfect for bridging the gap while AY-ZONIC-Core continues its evolution.
